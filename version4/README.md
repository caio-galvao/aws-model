# aws-model version 4
Does the same thing as version 3. The difference is that, in this version, the model itself (file new_aws_model) optimizes more than one instance at the same time. In the previous versions (2 and 3), the model optimizes one instance and it is called once for each instance.

This version should use more memory then the previous versions, but it is a step to make savings plans model.
